        This is a program that allows you to use Caps Lock the way
        Ctrl was used in GW-Basic. ☺ Simply hold it down as you press
        other keys and watch as unicode glyphs appear.
        
               ☼ Take advantage of these incredible features! ☼

         ► Relive the wonder of youth by making a smiley face only
           only one key press away‼
         ► Use the function keys to create blocks!
         ► Annoy friends and colleagues by sending characters which
           will not be shown correctly on their system‼
         ► Slow your computer to a crawl thanks to a mysterious 
           memory leak‼

            ♣ Caution: Before you have to much fun make sure your  ♣
                editor of choice will save the glyphs correctly.

 ‼ WARNING ‼
 ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
 This software comes with no warranty of any kind. It is untested and could
 do bad things to your system.

 ¶INSTRUCTIONS¶
 ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
 ► Build it by reading my mind and figuring out what to do*, or download the 
   pre-build version here: http://c768127.r27.cf2.rackcdn.com/GwKeys.zip
 ► Run GwKeysGUI.exe and a little notification icon will appear. To turn off 
   the feature, right click on it and select "Disable."
 ► If the program seems to misbehave (for example, if you seem to be stuck in
   glyph mode) hitting escape should fix it.
 ► If you leave this on all day you'll find its consuming a lot of CPU cycles.
   Maybe I'll fix it eventually, but for now just turn it off when you're
   finished making art.


 * J/K! Instructions on this will come later.
